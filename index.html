				2) compound interests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyiiqUQgEeA
					- Compound interest is when the interest you earn on a balance in a savings or investing account is reinvested, 			earning you more interest. As a wise man once said, 
						“Money makes money. And the money that money makes, makes money.”
						(https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/compound-interest/)
					- basically an interest of interest/s
					- diff of simple and compound:
						simple interests continuously base only from the initial input/deposit(principal)
						compound interest base from the initial input/deposit(principal) and the accumulated 
						interest deposit()

						</h2>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">

							discovering and understanding new things in life. Even if it is a small discovery. They both grow with time.
