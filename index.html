								<p class="fragment fade-up">is when the interest you earn on a balance in a savings or investing account is reinvested, earning you more interest. As a wise man once said,</p>

											</h2>
											
											<p class="fragment fade-up">An example of a financial security that pays investors interest-on-interest is the U.S. Savings bond, which is issued by a governmental body to raise funds from the public to fund its capital projects and other operations necessary to manage the economy.</p>

												<hr style="width: 300px; margin-left: 5px;">
											</h2>
											
										
											<p class="fragment fade-up">These savings bonds are zero-coupon bonds that do not pay interest until they are redeemed or mature. The interest compounds semi-annually and accrues monthly every year for 30 years. Every six months, the monthly interest calculation is adjusted to include the accrued interest from the previous six months.</p>

												<hr style="width: 300px; margin-left: 5px;">
											</h2>
											
											
											<p class="fragment fade-up">An investor who purchases the bond at the end of the month will still receive the interest accrued for the entire month since the Treasury only counts full months. Any interest paid at redemption or the maturity date is then issued electronically to the bondholder’s designated bank account.</p>

				<section>
										<h2 class="fragment fade-up" style="text-transform: none;">COMPOUND INTEREST <br> vs.<br> SIMPLE INTEREST</h2>

										<p class="fragment fade-up" style="text-align: justify;">Interest-on-interest differs from simple interest. While interest-on-interest applies to the principal amount of the bond or loan and to any other interest that has previously accrued, simple interest is only charged on the original principal amount.</p>

						<h2>
							Does interest apply to human knowledge level? why yes? why no?
						</h2>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">
							Yes, because like interests, human knowledge never stay at the same initial level. Everyday we keep learning, 
							discovering and understanding new things in life. Even if it is a small discovery. They both grow with time.

						<p class="fragment fade-up" style="text-align: justify;">
							Investing in workers has had a track record of creating better employment conditions in economies throughout the world. If employment is improving, consumer spending rises, leading to increased revenue for companies and additional business investment. As a result, employment is a key indicator or metric for determining how GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth may perform.
